Group size (groupsize) varies from 2 to 8 individuals. Each group maintains its own (almost exclusive) urban territory. Some territories are larger than others. The area variable encodes this information. Some territories also have more avgfood than others. And food influences the weight of each fox. Assume this DAG:\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere F is avgfood, G is groupsize, A is area, and W is weight. Use the backdoor criterion and estimate the total causal influence of A on F.

I want you to model their growth. Specifically, model the increments in growth from one period (Occasion in the data table) to the next. Each increment is simply the difference between height in one occasion and height in the previous occasion. Since none of these boys shrunk during the study, all of the growth increments are greater than zero. Estimate the posterior distribution of these increments. Constrain the distribution so it is always positive-it should not be possible for the model to think that boys can shrink from year to year. Finally compute the posterior distribution of the total growth over all 9 occasions."

Construct the posterior distribution.\n\n# define how many tosses were W & L\nw <- 4\nl <- 11\n\n# define p, every 0.01 between 0,1 \np <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\n\n# function to compute posterior by every p\ncompute_posterior <- function(W, L, poss){\n  ways <- sapply(poss, function(q) (q*4)^W * ((1-q)*4)^L)\n  post <- ways/sum(ways)\n  data.frame(poss, ways, post = round(post,3))\n}\n\n# compute posterior for our data\nposterior <- compute_posterior(w, l, p)\n\n# visualize posterior \nggplot(data = posterior) + \n  geom_line(aes(poss, post)) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  xlab(\"proportion water\") + \n  ylab(\"probability\")\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Bonus answer in solutions is somewhat key to understanding next answer. This specific problem, where you have a continuous value bounded by 0,1 with an infinite number of p, follows a beta distribution. Because the beta distribution is defined, you can instead just use that mathematical equation to come to the same conclusion as above.\n\nggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) dbeta(x, 4+1, 11+1), color = \"black\",\n                size = 1) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  xlab(\"p\") + \n  ylab(\"\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Using the posterior distribution from 1, compute the posterior predictive distribution for the next 5 tosses of the same globe. I recommend you use the sampling method.\n\n# sample our posterior (beta distribution with 4 W, 11 L)\nn <- 1e4\npost_samples <- rbeta(n, 4+1, 11+1)\n\n# sim globe function\nsim_globe <- function(p, N){\n  \n  sample(c(\"W\", \"L\"), size = N, prob=c(p, 1-p), replace = T)\n\n}\n\n# simulate posterior predictive distribution for next 5 tosses of the globe\n# how many of the 5 tosses will = W? Tested 1e4 times\npred_post <- sapply(post_samples, function(p) sum(sim_globe(p, 5)==\"W\"))\n\n# create table that counts number of incidences of each option (i.e., how many times will 0 W appear, 1 W, 2 W, 3 W, 4 W, 5 W?)\ntab_post <- table(pred_post)\npred_post_df <- as.data.frame(tab_post)\n\nggplot(pred_post_df, aes(as.factor(pred_post), Freq)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_classic() + \n  xlab(\"number of W\") + \n  ylab(\"count\")\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Can also use rbinom() function instead of sim_globe() since there are only two possible outcomes.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Use the posterior predictive distribution from 2 to calculate the probability of 3 or more water samples in the next 5 tosses.\nWe know that \\[ p = \\frac{ways}{sum(ways)} \\] Therefore, count the incidences of 3, 4, 5 in posterior predictive distribution from 2 and divide by total number of ways (1e4)\n\np_threeplus <- (sum(pred_post_df[which(pred_post_df[,1]==3 | pred_post_df[,1]==4 | \n                                         pred_post_df[,1]==5),2]))/n\n\nprint(paste0(\"p = \", p_threeplus))\n\n[1] \"p = 0.1853\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Suppose you observe W = 5 water points, but you forgot to write down how many times the globe was tossed, so you don’t know the number of land points L. Assume that p = 0.7 and compute the posterior distribution of the number of tosses N. Hint: Use the binomial distribution.\nBefore, we were solving for p using \\[ p^W(1-p)^L \\] Which was a beta distribution because p was a continuous variable bound between 0,1. Now we want to solve for N, with W and p. We have a success/fail dataset, with a probability of success, therefore we use the binomial distribution. We need to calculate the probability of 0-5 N’s resulting in 5 successes (W).\n\n# N & L = unknown\nW <- 5\np <- 0.7\nN_max <- 25\nlst <- seq(W, N_max, by = 1)\n\n# calculate binomial distribution for each N between lower bound (W) and upper bound (N_max) with p = 0.7\nx <- sapply(lst, function(x) dbinom(W, x, p))\n\nggplot(data.frame(data = x, N = W:N_max), aes(x = N, y = x)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(y = \"Probability\", x = \"N\") + \n  theme_classic()"
