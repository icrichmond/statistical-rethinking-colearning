-   number of tool types associated with population size

-   spatial covariation: islands close together share unobserved confounds and innovations

-   $\Delta T = \alpha P^\beta - \gamma T
    $

-   $T_i \sim Poisson(\lambda_i)$

-   $\lambda _i =  \hat{T}$

-   $\hat{T} = \frac{\alpha P^\beta}{\gamma}$

-   $\Delta T$ = change in tools

-   $\alpha$ = innovation rate

-   $\beta$ = diminishing returns

-   $\gamma$ = rate of loss

-   how do we add space into this?

    -   spatial covariation: islands close together share unobserved confounds and innocations

    -   effect of U is to make closer islands have more similar T

-   going to start by modelling spatial covariation among islands

    -   going to be varying intercept model

    -   $T_i \sim Poisson(\lambda_i)$

    -   $log \lambda_i = \bar{\alpha} + \alpha_{S[i]}$
