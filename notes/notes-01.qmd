## Rose / Thorn

*Rose:* excited for fewer examples + sensitivity analyses\
BONUS: I LOVE DAGS

*Thorn:* i am having a hard time imagining/extending my thinking re: causal imputation + unique null hypotheses (focus on causation)

## Third Edition

-   peach boxes instead of blue boxes

## Causal Inference

-   statistical models require scientific **(causal)** models
-   correlation is a very limited measure of association
    -   association can occur without correlation
-   *causal prediction* = prediction of the consequences of an intervention (implications of changing one variable on another variable)
    -   knowing the **cause** of an action allows you to create predictions
-   *causal imputation* = knowing the **cause** of an action allows you to reconstruct possible outcomes (i.e., what if I had done something else?)

## DAGs

-   abstract causal models: includes names of variables and their causal relationships
-   tells you the consequences of an intervention
-   facilitates you asking scientific questions

## Golems

-   statistical models = golems
-   often not possible to design and outline a null hypothesis that is meaningful to reject in observational science
    -   what is a null ecological community?
-   **think of good example/explanation for no null ecology/previous two slides**
    -   read textbook section
    -   focus on third example?
    -   takeaway is that null hypothesis does not give you cause/process behind outcome
-   what is your null? is it unique?

## TODO

-   read textbook section on null ecology
-   agenda
-   discuss code options
